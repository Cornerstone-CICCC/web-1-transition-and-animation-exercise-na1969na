# Web 1 - Transition and Animation Exercise

**Instructions:** Create an `index.html` and `styles.scss` and create the transitions/animations listed in the **Tasks**. Once you are done, commit and push your changes.

## Tasks

2. Using the same circle, create an animation that moves the circle to the edges of the screen and changes its shape between a circle and a square:

   top left (circle) => top right (square) => bottom right (circle) => bottom left (square) => top left (circle)

4. Create a loading bar that fills up from left to right.
